									<p align="justify">
									Since GAT is not directly a knowledge based test, it takes into account what a 
									student has learnt in his school/high school days up to Standard XII. Therefore, 
									practice becomes more important than just reading. It is advisable for candidates 
									to practise mock tests through various websites and books. A list of test web links 
									and practice books are indicated below- <br/><br/>
