                        Socialism differs from Communism in that is a tendency
                        not a body of dogmas. There is no authoritative
                        statement of its ideals upon which all are agreed and it
                        is possible for many who do not call themselves
                        sociologists to sympathize with some of their
                        principles. Whether under such conditions the theories
                        can be put to practise is a policy of advocating the
                        ownership and control of the means of production. It
                        seeks to balance a rigid discipline in what affects the
                        individual himself. It admits Mill’s distinction between
                        self – seeking and other – regarding actions, but it
                        claims that Mill’s miss – stated the problem by under
                        estimating the part played by economists. The main aim
                        of Socialism is the creation of equality, because it
                        holds that liberty is not worth having without the
                        security and equality it provides.
